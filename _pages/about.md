I am interested in using comparative genomics to deepen our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that give rise to and maintain genetic variation. During my Ph.D. at Aarhus University (Denmark), working with Professor Mikkel Schierup, I investigated the rate of horizontal gene transfer among sympatric species of the genus Rhizobium, as well as the impact of homologous recombination on adaptive evolution within these species. During a stay abroad at Przeworskiâ€™s lab (Columbia University), I studied the evolution and co-evolution of PRDM9-directed recombination gene across vertebrates. For my Postdoc now at UCLA at Lohmueller's lab, I am investigating the impact of different dominance models on the inference of the distribution of fitness effects.
