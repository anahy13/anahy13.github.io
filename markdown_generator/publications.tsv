16/03/2020	Symbiosis genes show a unique pattern of introgression and selection within a Rhizobium leguminosarum species complex	Microbial Genomics	"Bacteria are notorious for horizontal gene transfer, and it has often been asserted that this process will blur the boundaries between species to the extent that species cannot be clearly defined. Our study provides strong evidence that this is not necessarily so. Using 196 newly sequenced genomes of the Rhizobium leguminosarum species complex, we find five clearly distinct genospecies that occur in sympatry but show little evidence of recent between-species gene transfer affecting either the core or the accessory genome, except for a few highly mobile genetic regions."

29/07/2021	PRDM9 losses in vertebrates are coupled to those of paralogs ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2	bioRxiv (in revision)	"In mammals and likely throughout vertebrates, the gene PRDM9 specifies the location of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs) which are catalyzed by SPO11; in mice and humans at least, PRDM9 also aids in their repair. PRDM9 arose before the origin of vertebrates but was lost many times, either partially or entirely, and with it, it also lost its role in recombination. In this study, we leverage the the PRDM9 interdigitation along the vertebrate phylogeny to identify genes whose presence coincides with that of PRDM9 and thus may be interacting with it."
