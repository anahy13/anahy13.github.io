This course was organized by Professors at BiRC (Mikkel Schierup, Kasper Munch, and SÃ¸ren). 
I helped in the development of the exercises and I was the Teaching Assistant.

The course introduces key concepts in population genomics from generation of population genetic data sets to the most common population genetic analyses and association studies.
The first part of the course focuses on generation of population genetic data sets. The second part introduces the most common population genetic analyses and their theoretical
background. Here topics include analysis of demography, population structure, recombination and selection. The last part of the course focus on applications of population genetic
data sets for assoication studies in relation to human health.

The participants must at the end of the course be able to:

* Identify an experimental platform relevant to a population genomic analysis.
* Apply commonly used population genomic methods.
* Explain the theory behind common population genomic methods.
* Reflect on strengths and limitations of population genomic methods.
* Interpret and analyze results of population genomic inference.
* Formulate population genetics hypotheses based on data
