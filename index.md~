### Education
I am an undergraduated student in the fourth year of Agriculture Engineering and
an intern and researcher at the Genetics and Plant Breeding
([Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/), "Luiz de
Queiroz" College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo -
[ESALQ/USP](http://www.esalq.usp.br/) under the guindance of Professor [Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia](http://about.me/augusto.garcia) and involved in a project from [Scilifelab](http://www.scilifelab.se/) under the guindance of Professor Lukas Käll from the [Statistical Biotechnology Lab])(http://kaell.org/)

Studied in Sweden (Stockholm) at the Royal Institute of Technology- KTH as an exchange student for a semester taking courses in the Biotechnology program. The courses were:
BB2490 Analysis of Data fram High-throughput Molecular Biology Experiments (7.5)
DD2450 Algorithmic Bioinformatics (6.0)
BB2400 Bionanotechnology (7.5)
BB2480 Energy and Environment (7.5)


### Professional Activities

I am involved in a project hosted at [Scilifelab](http://www.scilifelab.se/) under the guindance of Professor Lukas Käll from the [Statistical Biotechnology Lab])(http://kaell.org/). The project is related with the investigation of proteomic data (mass spectrometry) by selecting and applying appropriate methods and tools for these large sets of readouts.  

### Research

My current research is related with the investigation and understanding of degree of the relatedness between cultivars and ancestors of Brazilian sugarcane breeding programme.The assessment of genetic diversity among cultivars is potentially an important tool for breeding purposes, specially for avoiding reduction of the genetic basis, that could result in inbreeding. The coefficient of kinship (f) can be a viable alternative for the analysis of genetic diversity. However the poliploidy complexity of surgarcane (6-12 ploidy) increase the need of a better method to improve the analysis and also allowing the better use of the current molecular markers information. 

### Lab

I am intern and undergraduated researcher at
[Statistical Genetics Laboratory](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/).For more information, visit the Lab
website.
